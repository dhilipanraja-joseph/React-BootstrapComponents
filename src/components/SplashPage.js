              Search results are also a powerful way to drive consumers to stores.
              A common myth is that as a result of searching online, shoppers will only visit e-commerce sites.
              In reality, three out of four shoppers who find local information in search results helpful are more likely to visit stores.

              Shoppers are actually inspired to visit after successfully finding out information such as the in-store availability of an item, store location and hours or pricing at a nearby retail location.
              But when that information isn't available, shoppers may stay away; one in four shoppers say they'll steer clear of a nearby store altogether to avoid the risk of items not being available.
